All the HTMX examples redone using a FLASK server backend.  

To see the original HTMX samples, go to 
https://htmx.org/examples/. 

The idea is to create server and client side examples 
that will display the full amount of effort required.

* Since HTMX is in flux I will be using developmental version of HTMX.  
* The most current version of HTMX is 0.0.4.
* To use this version, use:

 <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@0.0.4"></script>
