# htmxflask
All the HTMX examples redone using a FLASK server backend.  

To see the original HTMX samples, go to 
https://htmx.org/examples/. 

The idea is to create server and client side examples 
that will display the full amount of effort required.

* Since HTMX is in flux I will be using developmental version of HTMX.  
* The most current version of HTMX is 0.0.4.

## Client Side Notes:

* Example of how to use a particular version of HTMX in your web pages:

```html
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@0.0.4"></script>
 ```
 
 ## Server Side Notes:
 
 To "run" the python side myapp.py you need to have flask installed and possibly other
 modules. PIPENV is what you need to get it install and run.
 
 **pipenv install**
 
Then you can "run" the flask server with:

**pyenv shell**

**python myapp.py**
